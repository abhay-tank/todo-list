# Toodoo

Toodoo is a todo list project implemented using javascript.

Toodoo implements persistent Todo list using localstorage.

All todos are stored in array, which is then used to update DOM with todos.

On window load, localstorage is searched for existing todo list. If found it is fetched and UI is updated. If not a new todo list is made.

Upon operations on Todo List array, DOM and localstorages are also updated.

Project is hosted using Github at https://abhay-tank.github.io/todo-list/
